## 🛠️ Projects
### 1. [TribeVibe – Community Platform](#) *(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)*  
A MERN stack web app enabling:  
- User posts, comments, and topic-based discussions.  
- ML-based recommendations (content-based & collaborative filtering using TF-IDF, KNN).  
- Spam detection using SVM and Random Forest algorithms.

### 2. [ESG Risk Analysis & Prediction](https://github.com/shrayasic/esg-risk-analysis) 📊  
A complete data science pipeline to analyze and predict **Total ESG Risk Scores** of S&P 500 companies using ethical ML practices and advanced feature engineering.

**🧭 Goals:**  
- Predict ESG risk without circular inputs (i.e., avoid direct env/soc/gov score use).  
- Discover high-risk sectors and ESG patterns through explainable models.

**🛠️ Techniques Used:**  
- Data Cleaning & Storage: Handled missing values, type conversions, and stored in MySQL.  
- SQL + EDA: Used queries and visualizations to uncover sector-wise and controversy-related risk trends.  
- Feature Engineering: Created risk ratios, outlier flags, and custom ESG metrics (e.g., `governance_deficit_ratio`).  
- Dimensionality Reduction: Applied **PCA** to remove multicollinearity.  
- Association Rule Mining: Extracted rules like `controversy_high ⇒ soc_high` via **Apriori**.  
- Regression Modeling: Trained **XGBoost** (R² = 0.87, MAE = 1.80) using non-circular features.

**📌 Outcome:**  
A transparent, ethical, and domain-driven ML model for ESG risk prediction and interpretation.


### 3. CineRate – Movie & Cinephile App *(Flutter, Firebase)*  
A cross-platform app with:  
- Firebase Auth and Firestore for user login and review storage.  
- Real-time movie data integration via TMDB and RapidAPI.  
- Curated cinema-related video feeds and engaging UI/UX.

### 4. Resourcify – Resource Management System (Flask, React, MongoDB)
A web app for managing topics and resources with:
- Secure user authentication via JWT tokens.
- Topic and subtopic creation, update, and deletion.
- File uploads to Cloudinary for resource management.
- Responsive UI built with React and Tailwind CSS.
Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Flask, Flask-CORS, Flask-PyMongo, Flask-Bcrypt, Flask-JWT-Extended, MongoDB, Cloudinary, dotenv.
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Axios.


### 5. InvestHub – Stock Market Analysis Platform *(Python, Tkinter, MySQL)*  
A GUI-based platform offering:  
- Stock analysis, charting, comparison, and real-time notifications.  
- News aggregation and educational modules for enhanced user engagement.
